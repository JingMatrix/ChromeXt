<p><i>ChromeXt</i> adds UserScript and Dev Tools support to Chrome using Xposed framework.</p><p>Chromium based browsers, such as <a href='https://github.com/bromite/bromite'>Bromite</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Internet'>Samsung Internet</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/brave/brave-browser'>Brave</a>, are fully supported. Most WebView based browsers are also supported, if not, please report it.</p><p>Note for WebView based browsers users: you <i>only</i> need to enable this module for the browser application you wish to use, <i>not</i> for any possible WebView applications, _neither_ for the Android system.</p><p>Once installed, you can install UserScripts from popular sources: URLs that ends with <code>.user.js</code>. From the three dots page menu, ChromeXt offers you the <code>Developer tools</code> menu for the UserScript manager front end, and the <code>Eruda console</code> menu for other pages.
